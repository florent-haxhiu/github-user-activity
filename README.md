# GitHub User Activity Tracker

Made a quick CLI that tracks user activity in GitHub

## How to run

```bash
./github-user-activity <gh-username>
```

### Features

Later in the future

- [ ] Adding more information that might be useful (still need to think tbh)
- [ ] Add some sort of filtering from the user side (maybe in cli command like a flag?)
- [ ] Displaying it better (could link to filtering)
- [ ] Caching data to improve performance
